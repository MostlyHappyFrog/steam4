    <h2>Steam is well known for its name but did you know they wanted to name it somthing else?</h2>
    <p>Among the possible names for the Steam prototype, the developers considered the options "Grid" and "Gazelle", which, obviously, hinted at the speed of the program. Actually, apart from the connection with the name of Valve, it is difficult to explain why the choice finally settled on "Steam".</p>
